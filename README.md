This repository is home to an iOS version of the classic game, Pong. This game was chosen because of its relative simplicity to allow testing of simple physics systems, interactability, and data storage in iOS.

The essential requirements of the project are as follows:
recreate Pong in iOS and give the player a single life versus an AI opponent that has a decreasing handicap each time the player scores. Implement user controls, a main menu, and a high score list. Allow persistant data storage.
